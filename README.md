#Project Euler Solutions
I haven't done every solution in every language so here's a table to make things easier:

|Problems		| C# 	| F# 	| Java 		| Haskell 	| Python 	|
|-----------		|----	|----	|------		|---------	|--------		|
| Problem 1 	|    	|    	|[Solution](https://github.com/kkmonlee/Project-Euler-Solutions/blob/master/Java/Problem1.java) 	|         		| 		|
|  Problem 2         			|[Solution](https://github.com/kkmonlee/Project-Euler-Solutions/blob/master/C%23/Problem2.cs)    	|    	|     	 		|         		|        		|
|        		   	|    	|    	|    	 	 	|         		|        		|
|        		   	|    	|    	|     	 		|         		|        		|
